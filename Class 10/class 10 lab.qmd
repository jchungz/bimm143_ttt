# The PDB database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of biomolecular structures - the PDB.

Get a CSV file from the PDB database and read it into R.


```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

My pdbstats data frame has numbers with commas in them. This may cause us problems. Let's see:

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```
```{r}
as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
x <- "22,200"
as.numeric(x) + 1
```

We found a function called `gsub()` now we can figure out how it works

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", pdbstats$X.ray))
```

I can turn this snipet into a function that I can use for every column in the table

```{r}
commasum <- function(x) {
  sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
}

commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

Apply across all columns

```{r}
apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
```

```{r}
round(totals/totals["Total"]*100, 2)
```

84.54% + 8.72% = 93.26%

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(215684/249751891 * 100)
```

86.4%


> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?


# 2. Visualizing Protein Structure

We will learn the basics of Mol* (mol-star) homepage:
https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will play with PDB code 1HSG



Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogens atoms are tiny so the structure just depicts water molecules as 1


Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH 308

Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

Show the ASP 25 amino acids :

## Back to R and working with PDB structures

Predict the dynamics (flexibility) of an importnat protein:

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv <- read.pdb("1hsg")
hiv


```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```
Here we will do a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)
plot(modes)
```

Make a "movie" called a trajectory of the predicted motions :

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```


Then I can open this file in Mol*....
